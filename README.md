## About

oTree is a Django-based framework for implementing multiplayer decision strategy games.
Many of the details of writing a web application are abstracted away,
meaning that the code is focused on the logic of the game.
oTree programming is accessible to programmers without advanced experience in web app development.

This repository contains the games; the oTree core libraries are [here](https://github.com/oTree-org/otree-core).

## Quick start

Rather than cloning this repo directly,
run these commands:

```
pip install --upgrade otree-core
otree startproject oTree
otree resetdb
otree runserver
```
